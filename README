python3 classify_by_fuzzy_logic.py test.webm # to run classification by fuzzy logic, or:
python3 classify_by_decision_tree.py test.webm # to run classification by decision tree (works better)

classes.tsv are tagged with kuba.webm movie and deciion tree in is trained on it.
For decision tree test with test.webm in order not to make resubstitution.

opencv compiled against opencv_contrib and python3 bindings required
pip3 install sklearn # in order to use decision tree
pip3 install scikit-fuzzy # in order to use decision tree
